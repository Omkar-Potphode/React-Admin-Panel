**Technologies Used:**

- Material-UI (MUI)

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm start`.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a foundation for your React and MUI projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
